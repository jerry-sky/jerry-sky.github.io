# Jerry Sky's personal website

## Notice

This `master` branch doesn't hold any source files. Due to a GitHub limitation every personal/ organizational `github.io` website needs to be served from the `master` branch (that's why `master` contains compiled app files).

The `dev` branch holds actual source files. You can find it [here](https://github.com/jerry-sky/jerry-sky.github.io/tree/dev).
